                            <p>I am a rising junior at Columbia University pursuing a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science, with a focus on intelligent systems. I am also interested in the ethics and philosophy of Artificial Intelligence. </p>
                            <p style="color: white;">---</p>
                            <p>I am seeking a career that combines my passion for technology with my desire to solve large, multifaceted problems. After my undergraduate studies, I hope to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science, particularly in Machine Learning.</p>
                            <p style="color: white;">---</p>
                            <p>I am passionate about formulating and implementing creative, unique approaches to a wide range of complex questions. 
                                Computer Science has given me an incredible toolkit with which to do so and has taught me how to conceptually approach computational problems in an innovative, extensible manner. 
                                Currently, I am proficient in Java, C, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python, and NodeJS, and I have also worked in C++, Ruby, R, Markdown, and LaTeX. 
                                During this past summer, I grew tremendously as a software engineer and web developer during my software engineering internship at Amazon. 
                                I look forward to applying the skills I have learned this summer to future internships — including technical skills I have developed and broader skills such as managing long-term personal projects. 
                            </p>  
                            <p style="color: white;">---</p>
                            <p>Since first learning Computer Science, I have sought out leadership roles for large technical projects, which has taught me how to work effectively in teams and balance project management with being an individual contributor. 
                                I embrace the challenges and incredible learning that comes with leading technical projects. 
                                For example, as a Tech Contributor and web developer for Bwog, a student-run Columbia newspaper, I am constantly discovering new ways to manage and contribute to projects to ensure effective results. 
                            </p>
                            <p style="color: white;">---</p>
                            <p>I am currently an undergraduate Computer Science research assistant at Columbia. My research and academic interests are primarily machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the philosophy and ethics of integrating AI into our daily lives.
                            </p>
