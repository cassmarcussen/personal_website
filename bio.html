                        <p>
                            I was first extensively introduced to Computer Science upon joining the programming club in high school, where I quickly found that I was one of two female programmers in this space. 
                            Frustrated by the club’s lack of engagement with women in CS, I began a girls programming club focused on inclusivity. The club worked with the diverse background and skill sets of its members to build the mobile application Under My Wing, a sexual assault prevention app. 
                            I was motivated to engage deeply in Computer Science because of the social issues I saw in the field. 
                            I hoped to foster a community of female programmers as I engaged deeply in the field myself.

                            In high school, I gained experience managing and contributing to technical projects through my work on Under My Wing, a mobile application published on the Google Play store. 
                            Under My Wing is a mobile app seeks to equip women with resources to protect themselves from sexual assault, including self-defense tutorials, external links, and a 'fake phone call' feature. 
                            Under My Wing won Best in Nation and $20k in the 2017 Verizon App Challenge. My responsibilities included organizing team activity, promotional efforts, app creation, and website creation. 
                            Over the course of three months, I delegated roles to team members, mentored less experienced programmers throughout, and worked on shaping the app continuously as our vision came to fruition. 
                            This early exposure to project management, software engineering, and entrepreneurship sparked my growing passion for technology. It showed me how computer science gives you an expansive toolkit to innovate and have an impact. 
                            After publishing Under My Wing to the Google Play store, I was also invited as a guest speaker at events such as Random Hacks of Kindness Junior Hackathon and the Lisa Wexler Show to speak about my leadership role in the development of Under My Wing.

                        <p>
                        This experience inspired me to continue to develop my technical skills by intersecting technology with causes I am passionate about. 
                        I currently do this by contributing to startups as a freelance web developer, working directly with CEOs to improve the business’ online platform. 
                        For example, I helped a branch of the nonprofit Skip the Straw build an online platform to advocate for combatting plastic waste locally. 
                        I love working on projects that let me apply and expand my technical abilities in an innovative, socially conscious way.

                            I have also deeply explored the field of computer science, particularly software engineering, through past internships. 
                            After my freshman year of college, I interned at Amazon on the AmazonAPI team. 
                            This summer, I am interning for the Google and working on an open source project for Microsoft. Please visit my <a href="intern.html">Internships</a> page to learn more about these internships.

                            Currently, I am an incoming junior at Columbia University. I am studying Mathematics and Computer Science. 
                            I am particularly passionate about machine learning, intelligent systems, and data analysis. 
                            As I continue to learn and grow inside and outside of the classroom, I constantly strive to intersect my studies with the social impact of the subjects.
